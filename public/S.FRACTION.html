    <li>Mix the milk with the yeast, sugar, eggs.
    </li>
    <li>Melt the butter and add to the mixture.</li>
    <li>add in the flour and mix until combined into a dough.</li>
    <li>Knead the dough for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Transfer the dough into a large bowl and cover with plastic wrap.Leave it somewhere to rrise for 2 hours</li>
    <li>Lay two 18” lengths on plastic wrap on the counter, overlaying slightly on the long edges.  Oil plastic wrap.  Scoop dough onto center of plastic wrap.  Using well oiled hands, gently pat dough into a  rectangle (about 1/3-1/2 inch thick) with the closest edge to you about 18” wide.  Carefully spread brown sugar/cinnamon mixture onto dough, leaving a ½ plain edge of dough along the edge of the rectangle furthest from you.  Using the plastic wrap to support the dough, start rolling dough enclosing cinnamon nut mixture.  Wet edge of dough to seal.  Using a clean piece of dental floss cut dough into 16 pieces.  (Slide dental floss under the dough, cross the dental floss over the top of the dough and pull cutting through the dough.)  Place rolls in pan cut side down on sugar mixture.  Cover pan with oiled plastic wrap and allow to raise for 20-30 minutes. </li>
    <li>Remove plastic wrap and bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 30-35 minutes until golden brown.  After rolls have cooled slightly or completely (depends on your preference), drizzle with a glaze made of powdered sugar and second measure of milk substitute of choice.</li>
    <li>Allow rolls to cool completely.  Place in air-tight freezer bag or container, removing as much air as possible.  Seal, label and freeze. </li>
    <li>After cutting the rolls, place on a baking sheet lined with plastic wrap.  Place in the coldest part of your freezer until frozen solid.  The night before you bake your rolls, place rolls into an oiled baking pan.  Cover with oiled plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator.  In the morning, put risen rolls onto counter top while preheating oven to 350 degrees F.  Remove plastic wrap and bake at 375 for 30-35 minutes.  Serve plain or glaze as desired.  </li>
    <li><h4>For egg free version: </h4> Mix 2 Tablespoon ground flax seed, golden or dark varieties, with 6 Tablespoons hot water for each recipe (x1) made.  Let this sit for a couple of minutes, stir again, then add to recipe when the eggs are called for.</li>
